Alkira uses two public IPs from the segment’s “Reserved Public IPs for
User & Site Connectivity” to establish GRE tunnels to the 3 Akamai
Prolexic POPs . Each tunnel requires a configuration.

Under the **Akamai tunnel configuration** section, please specify the
following.

**Select Alkira Public IP** – select public IP from the dropdown menu.
Complete the prerequisite for reserving public IP on the segment for
each of three tunnels:

-  **RAN Tunnel IP –** Remote GRE tunnel IP for Akamai.

-  **Alkira Overlay Tunnel IP –** Loopback IP in Alkira for building BGP
   over GRE.

-  **Akamai Overlay Tunnel IP –** Loopback IP in Akamai for building BGP
   over GRE.

Similarly, specify the above-mentioned fields for the second public IP.
Here, two public IP addresses are used to ensure highly available
connectivity.

Under the **BGP** **configuration** section, specify the following
fields:

**Akamai BGP ASN (1-65534):** Specify BGP ASN used by Akamai PoP.

**BGP Authentication Key:** Specify the BGP Authentication key to
configure and verify peer with Alkira.

Under the **Select BYOIP Pool(s),** select a BYOIP address range from
the dropdown menu. For onboarding BYOIP in Alkira, refer to
`BYOIP <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oiXUhVFua_zO3KmJNKNUUN53FlPJspWwKN89Ip8b2nU/edit?pli=1#heading=h.vbo3q8xrr5p0>`__
section.

The last step is to configure the sizing and billing options for the
Akamai connector.
